Windsurf's new pricing and credit system introduces a tiered approach, with limited monthly credits for premium AI models and actions. Here are practical strategies to help you maximize your credits and avoid unnecessary spending:

**1. Prefer Free Features When Possible**

- Use the *Cascade Base* model for unlimited, free usage. It covers many everyday development needs and doesn't consume credits[^7].
- Rely on tab autocomplete for code writing and simple edits, as these actions often do not use up credits[^6].

**2. Optimize Credit-Consuming Actions**

- For simple code edits, use shortcuts like CTRL+I, which supports several models and does not consume credits[^6].
- Reserve premium models (like GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet) for tasks that truly require advanced AI capabilities[^7].

**3. Be Strategic with Cascade and Flow Actions**

- Avoid using Cascade (CTRL+L chat) for every minor task. Use it only when necessary, and prefer less expensive models (e.g., Flash, Seek R, or Base) for simple conversations[^6].
- Don’t use Cascade as a substitute for basic utilities (e.g., code formatting or rearranging lines), which can be done with standard tools[^6].
- For general questions unrelated to your codebase, use external resources like documentation or web search instead of consuming credits[^6].

**4. Leverage Cascade Autogenerated Memories**

- Take advantage of Cascade’s autogenerated memories, which store important context and details across sessions without consuming flow action credits[^8].
- By using these memories, you can avoid repeating research tasks and reduce the need for repeated prompts, saving credits in the long run[^8].

**5. Refine Your Prompts and Workflows**

- Craft prompts thoughtfully to get concise, efficient answers, reducing the need for multiple interactions[^6].
- For recurring tasks, create Cascade memories with general guidelines or overviews (like a README) to minimize repeated analysis and credit use[^6].

**6. Monitor and Analyze Credit Usage**

- Regularly review your credit consumption patterns. If you notice certain actions are draining credits quickly, adjust your workflow or prompt style accordingly[^6].
- If you hit credit limits on Flow Actions but still have User Prompt credits, focus on tasks that rely more on prompts and less on automated actions[^6].

**7. Avoid Unintended Credit Drains**

- When using Cascade for terminal or file operations, ask for command suggestions rather than letting Cascade execute actions, which can trigger unnecessary flow actions[^6].

**8. Consider Flex Credits and Plan Selection**

- If you need more credits occasionally, purchase Flex credits instead of upgrading your plan, as they roll over indefinitely and provide flexibility[^7].
- Only upgrade to higher tiers if your usage consistently exceeds the lower-tier limits.

**Summary Table: Key Tips to Avoid Wasting Credits**


| Action/Feature | Credit Use? | Advice |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Cascade Base Model | No | Use for most tasks |
| Tab Autocomplete/CTRL+I | No | Prefer for simple edits |
| Premium Model Prompts/Flow Actions | Yes | Use sparingly, only when needed |
| Cascade Autogenerated Memories | No | Use to store context, avoid repeated research |
| External Tools/Docs | No | Use for general or non-codebase questions |
| Flex Credits | Yes (paid) | Buy if you need occasional extra credits |

By following these strategies, you can make the most of Windsurf’s features without running out of credits or incurring unnecessary costs[^6][^7][^8].
