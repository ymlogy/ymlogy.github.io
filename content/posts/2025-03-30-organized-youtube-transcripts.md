**Product Specification: YouTube Playlist Manager Chrome Extension**  

---

### **Product Overview**  
A web app named Yttango designed for personal use to help efficiently assess the content of videos from YouTube playlists and channels by providing AI-generated summaries, metadata, and export tools. Selected videos arecan either be output as a list of URLs, for example for adding to a NotebookLM or other RAG system, or they can be added to a playlist on your Youtube channel.

**Note:** The user can add video URLs individually, or can add the URLs of Youtube channels or playlists in which case the app will generate an RSS feed URL for each channel or playlist, and then list and extract the contents of the most recent 15 videos of the feed (or any new videos that the app has not already processed, up to a maximum of 15 which is the limit for videos in Youtube feeds).

   - Uses the Youtube data API v3 to extract the required metadata.
   - Uses the youtube-transcript-api to extract the transcripts.
   - Passes the transcripts to Gemini 2.0 LLM for processing to produce the summaries and key takeaways.
