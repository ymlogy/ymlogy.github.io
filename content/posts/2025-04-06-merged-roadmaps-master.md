This roadmap consolidates the best aspects of the provided LLM-generated development roadmaps, ensuring a cohesive, logical, and comprehensive plan for building the Yttango application.

### Current Foundation

* Flask app with video URL input
* Transcript extraction via youtube-transcript-api
* Basic transcript display with copy-to-clipboard functionality


### Stage 1: Database Integration \& Basic Video Metadata

**Objective:** Set up the Postgres database and integrate it with the Flask app to store video metadata and transcripts.

**Prompt for LLM:**

```
I'm developing a YouTube video management application called Yttango. I've already built a basic Flask app that can extract transcripts from YouTube videos using youtube-transcript-api.

For this stage, I need to:
1.  Set up a Postgres database connection in my Flask app
2.  Create the initial database schema for storing video data
3.  Implement YouTube Data API v3 integration to fetch video metadata
4.  Store video data in the database
5.  Enhance the UI to display video metadata alongside transcripts

Here's my current app structure:
-   app.py (Flask main file)
-   templates/index.html (Basic form for URL input and transcript display)
-   static/css/main.css (Basic styling)
-   requirements.txt

Please help me implement:

1.  A database.py module with SQLAlchemy models for the videos table as specified in the schema:
    -   video_id (VARCHAR, PK)
    -   title (TEXT)
    -   channel_name (VARCHAR)
    -   channel_url (TEXT)
    -   description (TEXT)
    -   publication_date (TIMESTAMP)
    -   length_seconds (INTEGER)
    -   transcript (TEXT)
    -   date_added (TIMESTAMP)

2.  A youtube_service.py module that:
    -   Takes a YouTube API key
    -   Has a function to validate and normalize YouTube URLs
    -   Has a function to extract the video ID from different URL formats
    -   Has a function to fetch video metadata using the YouTube Data API v3

3.  Updates to app.py to:
    -   Connect to the database
    -   Handle video URL submission
    -   Fetch and store video metadata
    -   Display video metadata alongside the transcript

4.  Updated HTML templates using Tailwind CSS for a dark mode UI that shows:
    -   Video thumbnail
    -   Title
    -   Channel name with link
    -   Description
    -   Publication date
    -   Video length
    -   The existing transcript and copy button

Include proper error handling, logging, and documentation. Use Python 3.13.2 conventions and type hints where appropriate.
```

        -   date_created (TIMESTAMP)
    -   Add a "subject_area" column (VARCHAR, FK to subjects.name) to the videos table

2.  Create subject_service.py to:
    -   Retrieve all subject areas
    -   Add new subject areas
    -   Assign subject areas to videos

3.  Update the UI to:
    -   Display videos in a grid format with thumbnails

    -   Create a simple admin interface for database management
    -   Add user documentation accessible from the app
    -   Implement application metrics/monitoring

Please ensure all code is production-ready with comprehensive comments, docstrings, and follows best practices for security and performance. Include a requirements.txt file with pinned dependency versions and deployment instructions in a README.md file.
```


### Alternative Approaches

* **Transcript Extraction:** Besides the suggested methods (youtube-transcript-api, YouTube Data API v3, client-side extraction), consider exploring other third-party transcript extraction services as a fallback.
* **Caching:**  Consider using Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data, in addition to database caching.
* **Asynchronous Tasks:** For long-running tasks like feed synchronization or AI summarization, investigate using Celery or other task queues to avoid blocking the main application thread.
* **UI Framework:**  While Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js are good choices, consider other frameworks like React or Vue.js for more complex UI interactions and state management.
* **API Proxy:** explore alternative API proxy solutions, such as Kong or Tyk, for more advanced features like rate limiting, authentication, and analytics.
