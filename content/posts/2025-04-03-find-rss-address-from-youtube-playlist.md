To get the RSS feed of a YouTube playlist, follow these steps:

1. **Find the Playlist ID**:
   - Go to the YouTube playlist page.
   - In the URL, copy the text after `list=`. This is your playlist ID.

2. **Construct the RSS Feed URL**:
   - Use the following format for the RSS feed URL: `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=`
   - Paste the playlist ID after `playlist_id=`.

3. **Example**:
   - If your playlist ID is `PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR`, the RSS feed URL would be:
     ```
     https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR
     ```

4. **Note**: YouTube limits the RSS feed to the latest 15 videos. If you encounter issues or if the feed doesn't work as expected, consider using third-party tools like RSS.app to generate the feed[4][8].

Alternatively, you can use third-party services like RSS.app to create RSS feeds from YouTube playlists by simply copying and pasting the YouTube URL into their tool[4][8].
